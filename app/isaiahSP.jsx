                    Some skills I have would include Java, Python, javscript, I am currently learning how to use React Native.{"\n\n"}
                    I haven't made any fully working personal projects besides simple things such as a library system on intellij.{"\n\n"} 
                    However, with some friends and classmates, we have made some projects such as a simple tower defense type game that mimics "plants vs zombies" called "college vs students".{"\n\n"}

                    I have a few project ideas that I would like to work on in the future.{"\n\n"}
                    One of them is a Calorie Counting app that is easy to use. {"\n\n"}
                    Personally I have been trying to lose weight and was told by multiple sources to count my calories and protein.{"\n\n"}
                    However, what I realized was that they're alll either too expensive, not user friendly and innaccurate.{"\n\n"}
                    So, I would like to make an app that is free, easy to use and accurate for counting individual items and not just premade meals.{"\n\n"}
